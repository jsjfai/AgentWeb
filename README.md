## üöÄ Project Overview

This is an innovative smart agent interconnection ecosystem. It aims to solve the current isolation issue of AI agents and enable interconnection and collaboration between agents. Through the three-tier architecture of AgentDNS + DNSNode + MCP Client, a complete dynamic routing and collaboration mechanism for smart agents is built. This allows users to access and invoke various smart agent services through a unified interface.

The system breaks down barriers between different platforms, models, and smart agents. It realizes true collaborative work of smart agents and provides users with a more comprehensive and intelligent service experience.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

<p align='center'>
<img src='./resources/architecture_en.png' width="700" height="200" alt="AgentDNS Architecture" />
</p>

The system adopts a three-tier architecture design. Each component works collaboratively to form a complete smart agent interconnection ecosystem:

- **AgentConnector**: Serves as the user interaction interface and MCP Client. It is responsible for task input, semantic parsing, result display, and communication with AgentDNS.
- **AgentDNS**: Acts as the smart agent directory service. It maintains agent classification and service registration information, and provides agent discovery and routing functions.
- **DNSNode**: Functions as the smart agent service node. It hosts specific smart agent services, provides various tools and capabilities, and registers with AgentDNS.

---

## üîç Core Mechanisms

The system implements a complete set of dynamic routing and collaboration mechanisms for smart agents. The overall process includes six key steps:

### Task Semantic Parsing
1. Users input natural language task requests through AgentConnector (MCP Client).
2. The semantic parsing module preprocesses the input, including language recognition, word segmentation, intent extraction, and entity recognition.
3. The parsed results form a standardized task representation, which includes task category labels, target parameters, and execution constraints.
4. This representation serves as the input for subsequent routing and discovery.

### Dynamic Task Routing
1. Match the task representation with preset classification rules and Categories provided by AgentDNS.
2. If the task intent matches the semantic label of a certain type of agent, determine its corresponding category.
3. If multiple candidate categories are matched, a sorting algorithm based on semantic similarity is used to prioritize the optimal routing path.
4. If no match is found, mark it as "unknown" and enter the fallback process.

### Agent Discovery and Invocation
1. After the routing result is determined, AgentConnector queries AgentDNS for the DNSNode service entry under the corresponding category.
2. Based on the agent registration information returned by DNSNode, obtain the list of tools (get_available_tools) provided by the target agent.
3. Use semantic parsing results and large model reasoning capabilities to automatically generate tool invocation parameters.
4. Initiate a remote call through the execution interface (execute_tool) to obtain preliminary execution results.

### Task Collaborative Execution
1. For complex tasks, AgentConnector decomposes them into several subtasks according to semantic hierarchy.
2. Subtasks are assigned to multiple agents based on routing results, and executed in parallel or sequential collaboration mode.
3. The collaborative execution module aggregates multiple subtask results, resolves conflicts, and generates a unified output.
4. In cross-domain collaboration scenarios, it supports call chain tracking and result traceability.

### Feedback and Optimization
1. Return the execution results to AgentConnector for verification and feedback by users or the system.
2. Based on feedback information, optimize task semantic parsing and routing rules, and update the classification labels of AgentDNS.
3. The system automatically accumulates task-service invocation logs to form a self-evolving routing strategy library.
4. Through iterative optimization, improve the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent task execution.

### Fallback Mechanism
1. If the task fails to match any agent category, call the large model to directly generate an answer.
2. If part of the task matches successfully and part fails, adopt a hybrid output strategy: the matched part is executed by the agent, and the unmatched part is answered by the large model.
3. Ensure that tasks are not lost due to matching failures and improve system robustness.
